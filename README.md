#### Introduction

Climate and land use change are having tremendous impact on the natural environment and in turn on humans. In the Northeast, prior to European settlement, the forests were largely untouched. Beginning around 1650, two centuries of logging and agricultural clearing removed or cut almost all forest. In the mid-nineteenth century, agricultural expansion into the midwest and eastern industrialization led to population concentration in urban areas and widespread farm abandonment. This caused two centuries of natural reforestation which has continued until recently. A comparison of pre-colonial and modern forests based on archival, colonial land-survey notes and modern data from the Forest Inventory Analysis database found that while most major tree species remain 1) the relationship between forests composition and the environment has weakened and 2) pre-colonial forests were compositionally more homogenous at short distances and more heterogenous at longer distances.
